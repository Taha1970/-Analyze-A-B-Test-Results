# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results
Project of Udacity's advanced Data analysis Track
# overview
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce retail website. our goal is to help the company understand if they should:
-Implement the new webpage,
-Keep the old webpage, or
-Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision
# dataset 
ab_data.csv
# tools
python language
hypothesis testing
# statistics computed
Null Hypothesis
two-sample z-test
logistic regression
# result
 no need to switch from old page to new page as we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
